    When I need motivation
    My one solution is my queen
    'Cause she stay strong (yeah yeah)
    She is always in my corner
    Right there when I want her
    All these other girls are tempting
    But I'm empty when you're gone
    And they say
    Do you need me?
    Do you think I'm pretty?
    Do I make you feel like cheating?
    And I'm like no, not really 'cause
    Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
    She is always right there when I need her
